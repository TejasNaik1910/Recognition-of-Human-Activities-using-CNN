# Recognition_of_Human_Activities_using_CNN

Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to enhance the accuracy of human activities like walking, running, sleeping etc. The proposed solution performed better than Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with lower computational costs.
